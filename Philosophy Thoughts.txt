I think it's really interesting how despite the two types of trolly problems essentially being the same problem, the difference in how one affects the trolly completely changes how someone can approach it. Even when I pondered it, I had a moment where at first I thought I wouldn't push the man at first, but upon thinking about it realized that that would basically be the same as not pulling the lever.
